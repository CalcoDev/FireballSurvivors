# Godot Project Template

A starter template for my future Godot projects. I am planning to perpetually include more things as I discover the engine more and more.

## Disclaimer

This is made with the way I work in mind. It might not be suitable for anyone, or even myself, that is why it will probably be changing consistently, until I figure out a reasonable structure for most games.
